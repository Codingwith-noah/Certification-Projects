Hi! My name is Noah and I am working on earning coding certificates. This is a repository that I will fill with my projectsthat I am making in order to earn my coding
certificates from freeCodeCamp.org. After each folder name there will be a format of -p(#). The number after p is the number designated to the project. For example, the folder
with p1 after it is my first project. I hope you enjoy! You are free to use any of the files, but please make sure to credit me. In your footer of any HTML that you use please
add, "HTML format designed by Coding-With-Noah <a href="https://github.com/Codingwith-noah/Certification-Projects">check him out!</a>"
Thank you! Enjoy!
